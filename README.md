## A fork of just the Http part of the JavaLite framework

This is a lightweight and fluent Http client framework without any dependencies.
Several small, but incompatible changes have been made to remove dependencies, facilitate testability and add features to the original codebase.

For more information about the JavaLite framework, refer to its [main site](http://javalite.io).
